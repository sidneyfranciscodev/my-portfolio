        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a software engineer focused on building systems that
          work in real conditions — not demos. I care about architecture,
          security, and long-term maintainability more than trends.
          I’ve built and deployed multiple full-stack applications
          independently, handling everything from system design to
          production delivery.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m comfortable working across stacks and adapting
          to existing systems when required.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Experienced in designing backend architectures</li>
          <li>Skilled in full-stack application development</li>
          <li>Proficient in building authenticated, role-based systems</li>
          <li>Adept at integrating external APIs reliably</li>
          <li>Comfortable with both SSR and SPA approaches</li>
          <li>Committed to code clarity and maintainability</li>
          <li>Focused on balancing delivery speed with technical discipline</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Software Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          I believe in using well-understood technology combined with clear architectural
          principles. My goal is to create systems that other engineers can easily understand,
          maintain, and extend. I prioritize security, clarity, and discipline over novelty.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Clean architecture over clever code</li>
          <li>Security by default</li>
          <li>Explicit boundaries between systems</li>
          <li>Code that survives handover</li>
        </ul>
